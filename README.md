# Kaladin
This machine learning tool is aimed at automating cheat detection on Lichess using insights ([example](https://lichess.org/insights/thibault)).

It is built using CNNs on Keras/TensorFlow.

## Setup
You will need:
 - Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
 - Docker
 - MongoDB

## Docker container setup for Tensorflow with CPU or GPU

### Pre-requisites
Install Docker using your favorite package manager, or for example you can [follow this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker).

### Create custom image and container

Run `$./docker.sh gpu|cpu [dev|prod]` with the needed target, it will create/update the image and start the container. `dev` (default) will open `bash`, while `prod` will directly launch the queue manager: `python3 queue_manager.py`

### Useful commands

To restart the container: `docker restart kaladin`

To view the logs: `docker logs -f kaladin`


## Configuration

For the list of options and default values used by Kaladin, see `src/.env.base`. You can override these either by setting environmental variables or create a `src/.env` file.

The Kaladin repository was re-created when transitioning to open source to ensure that user data was not made public.  Git history was expunged during that transition.  A record of the commits prior to the transition can be found [here](doc/lost_commits.txt):
